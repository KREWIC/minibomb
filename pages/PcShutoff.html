            <h2>Objective</h2>

            <p>
              As a recent graduate, going from staying up until 3 AM every night playing Overwatch with my friends to responsible adult with a job and schedule has been... <i>an adjustment.</i> This program is a way to make sure you're
            PC shuts down at a specific time every night so you get the proper amount of sleep every night. Ultimately you'll set the nights of the week the program will be active, as well as a time bank. When the shutdown time approaches,
            a window will appear showing your remaining time before shutdown, the amount of time in your timebank, and a prompt to use some of that time as an extension for the night. It's a great way to keep from pulling the plug too early
            if you're in a situation where you can't do it convienently, like during a competitive game mode or getting to a proper saving point.

            <h2>The Code</h2>

            <p>  This again will be programmed in Python. Probably 2-3 libraries involved this time, TKinter, OS, and I might need a 3rd one for time management. This one is going to need about 2 windows to function properly. Setup and popup.
                The setup window will have:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A checklist for days of the week active</li>
                <li>Shutdown time field (likely 2 entry variables and a checkbox for AM/PM)</li>
                <li>Your total weekly timebank</li>
                <li>The amount of time before the warning message comes up</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As for the popup window it should only really need 3 things here:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of time left until shutdown (likely just a label in TK)</li>
                <li>Amount of time left in timebank</li>
                <li>Entry for the time you want to use from timebank</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In terms of getting this to work, the main things I have to overcome are setting up popup windows to trigger at a certain time, and the proper tracking of time. If I can figure those out, I think all I'll need to do is ensure
               the program runs when your computer starts up. That should complete this project.
