            <h2>Objective</h2>

            <p>
                This is designed to work with the spending plan application. The idea behind this project is to help you adjust your weekly spending when you have an item outside of what you can afford. After you enter the required inputs,
               you will receive both a slider for the spending plan you are comfortable with, and the number of weeks it will take. Then you can calculate the time based on a comfortabel spending plan, or the spending plan based on when you
               would want the item.

            <h2>The Code</h2>

            <p>
                This code runs similarly to the Spending Plan. It utilizes the python library tkinter. Only requires 2 inputs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Price of the item you are looking for</li>
                    <li>Your current weekly spending plan</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
                
            <p>
                It's important that you have determined what your weekly spending plan is or you will not be able to utilize this program effectively.
            Ideally this will be packaged with the spending plan in one program, but for the time being these are still 2 seperate programs.
            <br><br>
            The program uses 3 functions, each tied to a button from the tkinter library. spawnItems() is responsible for taking in the initial inputs for calculation and slider maximum values.
            It's also responsible for giving a physical location to sliders and buttons for the 2nd part of the program. The last 2 functions are also tied to their respective button, one that calculates the time based on an adjusted spending plan
            and one that calculates the required spending plan if you want the item in a certain period of time.

            <h2>Future Updates</h2>

            <p>The obvious thing to do with this is to fold it in with the spending plan into one financial application. If I were going to just make improvements to this specific application, 
                I'd create a way to change the slider from your adjusted spending plan to the amount you'd want to save, and also make sure that both the amount you are saving per week and your current spending plan are plainly stated.</p>
                <br><br>
            
            <p>
                  If I were to consider this as a standalone project, I'd set it up so that you can input multiple items that you would want to purchase. Then you'd essentially set up a 'savings account' within the program, where you'd set your
                reduced spending plan and determine the weekly contribution to the account. After that, the total you should have available would be on the program as well as that list of items you might want to purchase. When you can afford
                 one of the items the text will turn green. The longer you wait to spend your savings, the higher the value of item you will receive. It'd be an interesting way to sort of gameify saving money.
